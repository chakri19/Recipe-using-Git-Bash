My recipe is called Veg Manchurian. This dish is a fusion of Indian and Chinese cooking. The manchurian part refers to the people from northeast China who are called Manchus. Manchurian is a spicy sauce that uses chili sauce, ginger, vinegar, etc. Veg Manchurian is adapted from Gobi Manchurain in which gobi means cauliflower in Hindi. However, that uses a variety of sauces involving meat so Veg Manchurian means it is vegetarian. Across much of the Indian subcontinent, this dish is widely popular and can be found in street food, parties, and other ocassions.
